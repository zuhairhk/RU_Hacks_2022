# **Digitized Daniel**
## A multipurpose Discord Bot

Using primarily the *nextcord* API as well as others for the various features, the *Digitized Daniel* bot can do it all. Below is a brief rundown of each feature:

## **Light Controller**

With the help of the *TuyaIoT* API, any smart device can be controlled over Discord with Digitized Daniel using *slash commands*.
```
/light
``` 
Change the state of the bulb (ON/OFF)
```
/colour_set
```
Set the colour of the bulb, colours available are red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and pink
```
/mode
```
Toggle between different modes for the light which change the lights frequency and behaviour accordingly. Avaiable modes are white, colour, scene, and music. 

*White*: Pure white light, similar to natural daylight

*Colour*: Various colours available 

*Scene*: Allows the user to create conditions that control the bulb, such as external brightness 

*Music*: Changes colour to synchronize with music playing

## **Eye Detection**
Do you find yourself falling asleep behind your screen after working for long periods of time? Digitized Daniel can help! By using facial detection, the movement of your eyes can be tracked to determine if you are falling asleep. Digitized Daniel then alerts you using lights, audio clips, and sending a gif on Discord. 
```
$alert
```
Activates the "wake up" scenario which turns on lights, plays audio, and sends a gif.
```
$join
```
Instructs Digitized Daniel to join a voice channel you are currently in.
```
$leave
```
Instructs Digitized Daniel to leave the voice channel.

## **Search Function**
With Digitized Daniel, Google searches are possible right in Discord!
```
/search
```
Call the function, followed by whatever you'd like to search. Digitized Daniel will return the first result from Google. 

## **Pomodoro Timer**
Having trouble focusing when you're trying to study? The *Pomodoro Technique* is a method of staying focused by working for an interval of time, then taking a break for a smaller interval, and repeating this process. This increases productivity and prevents burnout.

 Digitized Daniel has a function to set a timer and keep track of how much time has elapsed, through Discord. 
 ```
 $start x y
 ```
 Starts a Pomodoro timer, where *x* is the study time interval and *y* is the break time interval.
 ```
 $time
 ```
 Displays how much time is left in the current study/break interval.
